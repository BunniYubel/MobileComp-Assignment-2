Idea: Bullet hell game (Think touhou) for mobile (android/ios, probably android) using the gyroscope as the movement input (primary feature)
secondary feature: use the camera/proximity sensor to allow zooming into the character to help dodge bullets

Player movement:
1. Player will not be able to infinitely scroll to one side of the map, they will hit a wall.
2. Player direction is dependent on gyroscope

Boss movement:
1. Boss may stay still or move left to right

Goal of the game:
1. Time attack?
2. Beat the boss (gain points per boss)?

Internet functionality:
1. Users log in using google
2. Upload their scores to the database

Basic features:
1. Pausing the game - Menu button is on the top right
2. Tutorial
3. Option to turn off music

UPDATES:
5/10: Made the scrolling background, installed the DanmakU engine for bullet hell patterns
