# MobileComp-Assignment-2
App for Assignment 2, Year 1 Sem 2 Mobile Computing

Idea: Bullet hell game (Think touhou) for mobile (android/ios, probably android) using the gyroscope as the movement input (primary feature)
secondary feature: use the camera/proximity sensor to allow zooming into the character to help dodge bullets

Player movement:
1. Player will not be able to infinitely scroll to one side of the map, they will hit a wall.
2. Player direction is dependent on gyroscope

Boss movement:
1. Boss may stay still or move left to right
